Readme for configuration

CONFIG.COM is the main configuration program for lEEt/OS. It can be used
to edit the basic settings such as video mode and desktop colors. The settings
are stored in the SETUP.INI file.

If the config file SETUP.INI gets corrupted, it can be easily fixed by deleting
it and then running CONFIG.COM and saving changes after that.

The settings are automatically reloaded, if CONFIG.COM is executed from
the Control Panel window.
