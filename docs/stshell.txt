Loading lEEt/OS directly as a DOS shell

lEEt/OS can be loaded directly over the DOS kernel without the command
interpreter in memory. Below are instructions how to do it.

  About STSHELL.COM

STSHELL.COM is the "bootloader" that loads lEEt/OS directly on top of the
DOS kernel. It does the following:

1. First the command interpreter is called to run AUTOEXEC.BAT.

2. Then a file named ENVS.TXT is searched in the root directory of the system
partition. If the file is found, the environment variables are read from that 
file and saved to the memory.

3. Finally the lEEt/OS MAIN.EXE program is started. The STSHELL.COM will be 
overwritten in the memory.

  Using SHELL.PTH

SHELL.PTH is the configuration file for STSHELL.COM. It must contain three 
lines. The first line must contain a full path to a command interpreter.
The second line must contain command line arguments that are passed to the
command interpreter. The third line must contain path to the directory where
lEEt/OS is.

  Example of SHELL.PTH:

C:\COMMAND.COM
/E:1024 /C C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
C:\LEETOS\


  Using STSHELL.COM
  
1. Move STSHELL.COM to the root directory of your system partition.

2. Edit the SHELL variable in your CONFIG.SYS or FDCONFIG.SYS. It must point
to the STSHELL.COM executable, for example:
SHELL=C:\STSHELL.COM

3. You may also want to add the line "SET > ENVS.TXT" to the end of your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. That ensures that every environment variable is passed to
lEEt/OS shell.
